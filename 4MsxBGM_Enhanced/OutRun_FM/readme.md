## Notes:

Ver 1.0 - Features 

Enhancement MSX RASTAN SAGA's BGM to the SEGA Master System(SMS) version.

      - Replace PSG BGM with OPLL YM2413 BGM released as Sega Master System Version

      - The MSX2 version of OUTRUN is a port based on the SEGA Master System(SMS) version, 
      	but it was ported with the PSG version instead of the one using YM2413, 
       	which made the music quite lacking.

      - OUTRUN 3D (SMS) features the famous track 'Magical Sound Shower' along 
      	with original tracks, reducing the disconnect in quality with the arcade version 
       	while emphasizing the unique originality of the SMS version.
     	
      - These elements align well with the MSX version, 
      	which is why I decided to port the BGM from OUTRUN 3D to the MSX version.
