## Notes:

Ver 1.0 - Features 

Enhancement MSX Thexder's BGM .

      Despite being high-quality, the PSG version of the music, 
        which is rarely played due to the iconic MSX FM BGM, has been ported to MSX THEXDER.

      Even though Thexder seems perfect as a game, 
        the BGM that wasn’t suitable for long play sessions always bothered me. 

      Due to the overwhelming quality of the BGM using FM (YM2413) in the sequel 'FireHawk,' the PSG version, 
        although made with high quality, seemed to never find its place. 

      It felt like it didn’t quite fit in with FireHawk, 
        so with the intent to find its rightful home, I decided to port it to Thexder."
